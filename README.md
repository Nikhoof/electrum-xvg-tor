## 1.a) Getting Started With Ubuntu/Linux:
```
sudo apt-get update
```

```
sudo apt-get install tor
```

```
sudo service tor start && sudo service tor stop
```

####  1.) Go to /etc/tor/ and edit the torrc file. _(you can use sudo nano torrc)_
```
cd /etc/tor
```

```
sudo nano torrc
```
#### 2.) Remove the # before the line that starts with SocksPort 9050: 


Before:
```
## Tor opens a SOCKS proxy on port 9050 by default -- even if you don't
## configure one below. Set "SOCKSPort 0" if you plan to run Tor only
## as a relay, and not make any local application connections yourself.
#SOCKSPort 9050 # Default: Bind to localhost:9050 for local connections.
#SOCKSPort 192.168.0.1:9100 # Bind to this address:port too.

```

After:
_(should look like this)_
```
## Tor opens a SOCKS proxy on port 9050 by default -- even if you don't
## configure one below. Set "SOCKSPort 0" if you plan to run Tor only
## as a relay, and not make any local application connections yourself.
SOCKSPort 9050 # Default: Bind to localhost:9050 for local connections.
#SOCKSPort 192.168.0.1:9100 # Bind to this address:port too.

```

#### 3.) Save torrc:
```
CTRL+X > Y > ENTER
```

#### 4.) Restart Tor:
```
sudo service tor restart
```


## Now we install the electrum wallet:

```
sudo apt-get install git pyqt4-dev-tools python-pip python-dev python-slowaes python-pip
```

```
sudo pip install pyasn1 pyasn1-modules pbkdf2 tlslite qrcode
```

```
git clone https://github.com/vergecurrency/electrum-xvg-tor && cd electrum-xvg-tor
```

```
pyrcc4 icons.qrc -o gui/qt/icons_rc.py
```

```
sudo python setup.py install
```

```
chmod +x ./electrum-xvg
```

## To run Electrum from this directory, just do:

```
./electrum-xvg
```

## To start Electrum from your web browser, see:

http://electrum-verge.xyz/Verge_URIs.html


## To update your copy of the electrum client:

```
cd electrum-xvg
```
```
git pull
```
```
sudo python setup.py install
```



## 1.b) Installing TOR Browser


#### 1.) Download the latest Tor browser from the official distribution website:

https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en

#### 2.) Download the architecture-appropriate file above, save it somewhere, then run one of the following two commands to extract the package archive:

```
tar -xvJf tor-browser-linux32-7.5.3_LANG.tar.xz
```
###### or (for the 64-bit version):

```
tar -xvJf tor-browser-linux64-7.5.3_LANG.tar.xz
```
###### _(where LANG is the language listed in the filename)._

#### 3.) Once that's done, switch to the Tor browser directory by running:

```	
cd tor-browser_LANG
```
#### 4.) To run Tor Browser, click either on the Tor Browser or the Tor Browser Setup icon or execute the start-tor-browser.desktop file in a terminal:

```
./start-tor-browser.desktop
```

###### Note: Before you can use Tor browser you need to configure the Tor network settings. If you currently reside in a country that does not have connection limitations on Tor, Simply press connect and Tor browser will automatically configure itself.

---------------------------------------------
###### _Tor Browser is required to be open and running in the background in order for the electrum tor wallet to connect._
---------------------------------------------



## 1.c) TOR Browser Setup Instructions For Countries With Restrictions: 


#### If Tor is blocked in your country:

##### 1.) Click the Configure button to use a bridge or proxy to connect to Tor.

##### 2.) In the next window, Select Yes.

##### 3.) Next, select the default obfs4 bridge.

##### 4.) The next window asks you if you need to use a local proxy to access the Internet. Normally you can connect the Tor network via Tor bridge so just select No.

After that, the Tor browser will try to establish a connection to the Tor network.

###### _If the connection failed, then go back to the previous step and configure a proxy to access the Internet. See 1.d below_



## 1.d) Setup Instructions for ShadowSocks

#### Debian/Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get update
```
```
sudo apt-get install python-pip 
```
```
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools m2crypto
```
```
sudo pip install shadowsocks
```
#### CentOS/RHEL
```
sudo yum install m2crypto python-setuptools
```
```
sudo easy_install pip
```
```
sudo pip install shadowsocks
```
#### Create a configuration file:
```
sudo nano /etc/shadowsocks.json
```
#### Put the following text into the file:
```
{
"server":"your_server_ip",
"server_port":8000,
"local_port":1080,
"password":"your_passwd",
"timeout":600,
"method":"aes-256-cfb"
}
```
#### Explanation of each field:
```
server:  your hostname or server IP (IPv4/IPv6).
server_port:  server port number.
local_port:  local port number.
password:  a password used to encrypt transfer.
timeout:  connections timeout in seconds.
method:  encryption method, “bf-cfb”, “aes-256-cfb”, “des-cfb”, “rc4”, etc. Default is table, which is not secure. “aes-256-cfb” is recommended.
```

#### To save:

CTRL+X > Y > ENTER

#### Start shadowsocks server:
```
sudo ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d start
```
#### To stop shadowsocks server:
```
sudo ssserver -d stop
